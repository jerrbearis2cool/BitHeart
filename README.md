<h1>Bitheart</h1>
<p>We are an ambitious project aiming to bridge the massive potential of Web3 with the case of charitable action.</p>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
A big chunk of inspiration was taken from faucets that help pay my everyday transaction gas fees. I thought how i could reverse the processes to enable funding for organizations.

<h2>What it does</h2>
Bitheart is a website that allows diverse crypto options for donations to charity.

<h2>How I built it</h2>
I built the project mainly using python flask as the front and back end, and my database is PostgreSQL. I used an open source web building framework called grapesjs for the majority of my html pages.

The biggest tool that helped my journey was the Circle API documentation, it allowed me to follow along and understand usages at the pace that I needed.

<h1>Challenges I ran into</h2>
Since I joined the hackathon with only 7 days left to spare, I struggled to maintain a workflow that would get me to my target efficiently. I had to cut out many features that I had on mind such as direct wallet interactions within the frontend.

<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>
I am extremely proud of how I finished the project with enough time to spare, even with a massive time constraint, as well as soloing such a massive project.

I am also proud of my decision to embark on my hardest project yet, as I have never integrated any payment methods ever into my projects. Overall, choosing web3 as the main aspect of my project was a huge leap in my own development further into computer science.

<h2>What I learned</h2>
Although I joined weeks late into this hackathon, I was able to gain knowledge that was unprecedented to me in the field of crypto development. Through circleâ€™s amazing documentation, I was able to create my first ever project that incorporated crypto.

<h2>What's next for BitHeart</h2>
<b>The following is a brief roadmap for the future of Bitheart.</b>

enable different chains such as Ethereum, as well as new tokens such as USD-T
find charity organizations to distribute to
move circle API out of test networks.
implement automatic chain bridging and token exchange into a main pool of tokens
